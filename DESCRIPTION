Description: 
    Provides tools for dissecting a package namespace or "covr" coverage object
    in order to cross reference tested code with the lines that are evaluated, as
    well as linking those evaluated lines to the documentation that they are
    described within. Connecting these three pieces of information provides a
    mechanism of linking tests to documented behaviors.
